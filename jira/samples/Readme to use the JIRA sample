Readme to use the JIRA sample: 

About the sample: 

The sample application demonstrates the usage of JIRA connector. The users are assumed to have access to the JIRA server referred in the sample. 
Basic Authentication is enforced to ensure the users accessing the JIRA server have valid permissions to do so. 

Steps: 

- Import the JIRA Query application in BusinessStudio. 
- Provide the AD credentials in the Identity Provider shared resource under Resources folder of the application. 
- Modify the host and port of the JIRA server in the HTTP Client shared resource, if required. The sample points to the JIRA server used by TIBCO Engg and the users need to have access to this particular JIRA server. 
- JiraQuery activity has the JQL provided in the Input tab. Users can modify the JQL per the required usecase. 
- Run/Debug the application in BusinessStudio to test the application. 

Sample Input: 

jql="project=ambw and resolver=hnembhwa and status != Closed"

Sample Output:

Aditya/Hitesh,\r\n\r\nWe fixed an issue related to \"javax.jms.IllegalStateException: Illegal use of receive() from multiple threads\" in BW 6.2.2 HF03(Please see the email for reference as this is not explicitly mentioned in the JIRA#AMBW-20566)\r\n\r\nThe customer AA is facing the issue again in BW 6.3.2(not always but randomly).\r\nProblem is we do not have project to simulate \"javax.jms.IllegalStateException: Illegal use of receive() from multiple threads\" in the JIRA. I did test with the attached project in the JIRA and I do not see temporary queue issue.\r\n\r\nSo we have two questions:\r\n1. Is this issue fixed in BW 6.3.2 or in any hotfixes implicitly?\r\n2. Please can we get the project where we tested this issue so that I can try simulate at my end(customer himself cannot zero in on a single application. He says he observe this issue randomly in SOAP Reference. So this issue is difficult to simulate)\r\n\r\nHe is using Auto Ack mode.

There seems to be an issue with the swagger generator with the enum type.\r\n\r\nFor #1, there is already a defect AMBW-23869. \r\n For #2 and 3, if you open the json files (e.g appspaces.json) in the attached BWAgentSwaggerFile  you will see many \"Map(string, string)\" and \"$ref\" definition.\r\n\r\nTo reproduce:\r\n1.start bwagent\r\n2.start bwagent apiserver\r\n3.start swagger ui, http://localhost:5555, click \"raw\" button on the right side (see attached screenshot), you can see the json file, save it.\r\n","customfield_10130":null,"customfield_11341":null,"customfield_10012":null,"customfield_11344":{"self":"https://jira.tibco.com/rest/api/2/customFieldOption/13500","value":"Documentation","id":"13500"},"customfield_10013":{"self":"https://jira.tibco.com/rest/api/2/customFieldOption/10000","value":"ALL","id":"10000"},"customfield_11343":null,"customfield_10014":[{"self":"https://jira.tibco.com/rest/api/2/customFieldOption/10017","value":"All","id":"10017"}],"customfield_10015":null,"customfield_11345":null,"summary":"Support<MAIF SA> BWAgent Web API swagger definition not correct","customfield_10080":{"self":"https://jira.tibco.com/rest/api/2/user?username=hnembhwa","name":"hnembhwa","key":"temphnembhwa","emailAddress":"hnembhwa@tibco.com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://jira.tibco.com/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10252","24x24":"https://jira.tibco.com/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10252","16x16":"https://jira.tibco.com/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10252","32x32":"https://jira.tibco.com/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10252"},"displayName":"Hitesh Nembhwani","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"customfield_12141":null,"customfield_12140":null,"customfield_10240":null,"customfield_10241":"9223372036854775807","customfield_12541":null,"customfield_10000":{"self":"https://jira.tibco.com/rest/api/2/user?username=jyao","name":"jyao","key":"jyao","emailAddress":"jyao@tibco.com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://jira.tibco.com/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10252","24x24":"https://jira.tibco.com/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10252","16x16":"https://jira.tibco.com/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10252","32x32":"https://jira.tibco.com/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10252"},"displayName":"Jiao Yao","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"customfield_12540":null,"customfield_10640":null,"customfield_10641":null,"environment":null,"duedate":null}},{"expand":"operations,editmeta,changelog,transitions,renderedFields","id":"992854","self":"https://jira.tibco.com/rest/api/2/issue/992854","key":"AMBW-24328","fields":{"customfield_11040":null,"customfield_11041":null,"fixVersions":[],"customfield_10110":null,"customfield_11440":"0|i409y2:","customfield_10111":null,"resolution":{"self":"https://jira.tibco.com/rest/api/2/resolution/1","id":"1","description":"A fix for this issue is checked into the tree and tested.","name":"Fixed"},"customfield_10112":null,"lastViewed":null,"customfield_10340":null,"customfield_12640":null,"customfield_10220":{"self":"https://jira.tibco.com/rest/api/2/user?username=sponnusa","name":"sponnusa","key":"sponnusa","emailAddress":"sponnusa@tibco.com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://jira.tibco.com/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10252","24x24":"https://jira.tibco.com/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10252","16x16":"https://jira.tibco.com/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10252","32x32":"https://jira.tibco.com/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10252"},"displayName":"Siva Ponnusamy","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"customfield_10341":null,"priority":{"self":"https://jira.tibco.com/rest/api/2/priority/3","iconUrl":"https://jira.tibco.com/images/icons/priorities/major.png","name":"High","id":"3"},"customfield_12642":null,"customfield_12641":null,"customfield_10740":null,"labels":[],"timeestimate":null,"aggregatetimeoriginalestimate":null,"versions":[{"self":"https://jira.tibco.com/rest/api/2/version/27599","id":"27599","description":"GA release following 6.3.1","name":"6.3.2","archived":false,"released":true,"releaseDate":"2016-05-10"}],"issuelinks":[{"id":"294477","self":"https://jira.tibco.com/rest/api/2/issueLink/294477","type":{"id":"10020","name":"Related","inward":"is related by","outward":"related","self":"https://jira.tibco.com/rest/api/2/issueLinkType/10020"},"outwardIssue":{"id":"637340","key":"AMBW-21132","self":"https://jira.tibco.com/rest/api/2/issue/637340","fields":{"summary":"Support<CITI> LDAP support for user authentication of bwagent REST API ","status":{"self":"https://jira.tibco.com/rest/api/2/status/6","description":"The issue is considered finished, the resolution is correct.
